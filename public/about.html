<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Greetings! My name is Victoria and this is my first ever website! Woo hoo.
  Exciting, yes? It is currently December 19, 2023 and we are learning how to
  create a simple website utilizing HTML. Nothing too crazy, but I am learning
  more skills each day that passes. I overcompliacted the nesting/embedding
  module, but luckily I figured it out.

  My goal is to become a full-time remote Full Stack Engineer and will be
  applying to a bootcamp shortly after the completion of this course.
